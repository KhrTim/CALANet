                    STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE TESTS - SUMMARY
==================================================================================

✅ YES! Statistical tests ARE ALREADY INCLUDED in both PDFs:

1. reviewer_response_tables.pdf
   └─ Tests computed from COLLECTED DATA
   └─ Shows which models differ significantly from CALANet

2. hybrid_tables.pdf  
   └─ Tests computed from PAPER DATA
   └─ Shows which models differ significantly from CALANet

==================================================================================
                              HOW TO READ THE TABLES
==================================================================================

MARKERS:
  ▼ ($lacktriangledown$) = Model is significantly WORSE than CALANet (p < 0.05)
  △ ($artriangle$)        = Model is significantly BETTER than CALANet (p < 0.05)
  (no marker)              = No significant difference (p >= 0.05)

EXAMPLE FROM HAR TABLE:
  Model              | UCI-HAR  | DSADS    | Meaning
  -------------------|----------|----------|----------------------------------
  Proposed (CALANet) | 89.5     | 79.4     | Baseline (no markers)
  SAGoG              | 20.0 ▼   | 0.8 ▼    | Significantly worse (p=0.043)
  MILLET             | 93.0     | 82.9     | Not significantly different
  IF-ConvTransformer | 93.6     | ---      | Not significantly different

TEST METHOD:
  • Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test (non-parametric, paired)
  • Compares each model to CALANet across all datasets
  • Significance level: α = 0.05 (95% confidence)
  • Appropriate for small sample sizes (6 datasets)

                         WHAT THE REVIEWER REQUESTED
==================================================================================

Reviewer asked for: 'statistical significance tests (e.g., t-test or Wilcoxon)'

✅ We provided: Wilcoxon signed-rank test at 95% significance level
✅ Displayed as: Markers in every effectiveness table
✅ Documented in: Table captions explain the markers

==================================================================================
                                FILES TO USE
==================================================================================

RECOMMENDED: reviewer_response_tables.pdf
  └─ Has ALL metrics reviewer wants (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, etc.)
  └─ Has statistical significance markers ✅
  └─ Has all efficiency metrics ✅
  └─ Uses collected data (complete dataset)

ALTERNATIVE: hybrid_tables.pdf
  └─ Uses paper F1/Accuracy values (matches your publication)
  └─ Has statistical significance markers ✅
  └─ Has all efficiency metrics ✅
  └─ BUT: Cannot provide separate Precision/Recall (not in paper)
